# automated_tool_imaging_interface

Software for the automated tool imaging machinery prototype for use and proof-of-concept by SECO.

## Project Overview

This repository contains software to operate and interface with an automated imaging system designed for tool inspection, logging, and analysis. The system aims to streamline tool monitoring in industrial environments by automating the process of capturing, processing, and storing images of various tools.

Note that some of the python code in the repo is from the Automated Tool Imaging System from last semester (SP25) and is not up-to-date with our current goals. Such files are uploaded to the repo primarily for referencing purposes.

## Features

- Automated image capture and storage
- Image processing and analysis capabilities
- User-configurable workflow and settings
- Logging and reporting of tool conditions
- Modular design for easy integration with different machinery
- Proof-of-concept implementation for SECO

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+ (recommended)
- [List any required hardware or imaging devices]
- [List any additional system dependencies]

### Installation (WIP)

Clone the repository:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/YeeJuiceMan/automated_tool_imaging_interface.git
cd automated_tool_imaging_interface
```

Install required Python packages (if any):

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Usage (WIP)

Configure hardware and settings as needed. Then run the main application:

```sh
python main.py
```

Refer to the documentation in the `docs/` folder (if available) for advanced usage and configuration options.
